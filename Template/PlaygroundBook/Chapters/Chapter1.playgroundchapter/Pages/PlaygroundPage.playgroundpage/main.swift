 # Why Robotic?
 
 In today’s’ technology-driven world, it’s important now more than ever to prepare students for the future.
 Teaching robotics to young students can increase their ability to be creative and
 innovative thinkers and more productive members of society. Many governments have already recognized the
 importance of robotics in the classroom and have begun to create programs and laws that would incorporate it into
 their public education system. By teaching our students the basics of robotics, we can open a whole new world to
 them and exciting opportunities that they wouldn’t have access to otherwise.
 
 
 ## Tha's why we are here, to make your first robot !
 
Here we have all the pieces to make a robot, legs, arms, body and head. This is one of many types of robots, this is a humanoid robot, which looks like us, Huaman beings, others look like animals, like a dog and some others look like a ball.
 
 
 + Important:  You can learn to make many othors if you study. You can !

 
Now, it`s time to build! Follow this instructions that in the end of this page you will have a full robot made!
 
 
 # Instructions 
 
     1. Take the robot's head and place it in the same place as your shadow.
     2. Drag the body under the head, so that we can place the limbs.
     3. Put your arms so that the robot picks up things.
     4. Finally, place the legs of the robot so that it can walk (if it doesn't fit, try the other position).
