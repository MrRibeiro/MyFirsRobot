 # This is me!
 
 Hello, my name is Leonardo Gomes, I'm 22 years old, I'm from Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.
 Currently studying Computer Engineering at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Cear√° - IFCE and participating in the Apple Developer Academy program.
 I chose this robotics theme, because it was this area that I started my studies in college, participating in other laboratories using embedded systems and robotics, I learned a lot and I feel that I must pass on the experiences I had and encourage new generations to learn too.
