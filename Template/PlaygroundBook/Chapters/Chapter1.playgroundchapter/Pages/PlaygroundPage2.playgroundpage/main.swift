 # The Battery!
 
 The battery it's what is missing, without it, your robot will not work!
 

 With robotics we can learn countless things, such as electronic basics, how to turn on a led, use a motor, even programming, using artificial intelligence to make your robot walk alone!
 What exactly is robotics? Essentially, a robot is a mechanical device that can be programmed to follow a set of instructions. The robot has a processing unit, sensors to perceive its environment, and motors and actuators to move its limbs or wheels. It may speak, make other sounds, or flash with lights and colours in response to the environment as per instructions. Robots need the ability to follow programmed instructions and not just be controlled remotely.
